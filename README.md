# BioArtBot Pixelizer
An image importing and pixelizing demo notebook for BioArtRobot

Open pixelizer.ipynb with a Jupyter Notebook server and follow the instructions in the cells to parse any .jpg image and send it to BioArtBot for bio-printing.

This code can be played with further to create still more interesting images. To print the results of any image processing with BioArtBot, the code just needs to send data to the API at bioartbot.org following the data format demonstrated in the notebook.

If you do anything cool with this code, let us know with an email to contact@bioartbot.org!
